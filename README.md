# snake&Ladder
The gist of the problem statement is that we need to create a snake and ladder game. The game will have multiple snakes and ladders and there will be multiple people playing the game. The game is played automatically based on certain rules and ends when a player wins.

Here I’ve decided that I’ll keep a Driver class to take input from the user and a process to start the game.
